# notes
Notes manager.

* Notes are plain text files (txt,md,troff,...).
* CLI interface.
* NCurses interface (run it without arguments).

The application created to works well with Nextcloud Notes, and designed to
behave as `man` utility too.

You will need my [md2roff](https://github.com/nereusx/md2roff) utility to create the man pages.

## Installation

First install md2roff from https://github.com/nereusx/md2roff if you have not
already. Run 'cd notes; make install'.

```
git clone https://github.com/nereusx/notes
cd notes
make install
```
