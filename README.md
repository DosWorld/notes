# notes
Notes manager.

* Notes are plain text files (txt,md,troff,...).
* CLI interface.
* NCurses interface (run it without arguments).

The application created to works well with Nextcloud Notes, and designed to
behave as `man` utility too.

You will need my [md2roff](https://github.com/nereusx/md2roff) utility to create the man pages.
